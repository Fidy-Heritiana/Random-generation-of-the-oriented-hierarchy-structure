# Random-generation-of-the-oriented-hierarchy-structure
This program aims to randomly generate the oriented hierarchy structure used in Statistical Implicative Analysis by means of a Boltzmann sampler. It provides two algorithms: one for generating the hierarchy structure itself, and another for counting the number of blocks in each generated structure.
